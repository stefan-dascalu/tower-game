## Description

This project is a simple tower game implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. The player drops blocks in an attempt to stack them as high as possible while avoiding misalignment. The game tracks scores and displays a leaderboard.

## Key Concepts Used

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The project demonstrates the use of classes and objects to encapsulate data and behavior. Key classes include `Block`, `Leaderboard`, `PlayerScore`, and UI components like `StartScreen` and `LeaderboardScreen`.
- **Java Swing**: Swing is utilized for building the graphical user interface. This includes the use of `JFrame`, `JPanel`, and various UI components such as buttons and graphics rendering.
- **Event Handling**: Action listeners are implemented to respond to user interactions, such as clicking buttons or pressing keys, allowing for a dynamic user experience.
- **Graphics and Drawing**: Custom painting methods are used to render game elements and UI components on the screen.
- **Data Structures**: A `TreeMap` is employed to manage the leaderboard scores in a sorted manner.

## Features

- Start screen with options to play, view the leaderboard, or quit the game.
- Leaderboard to display the top scores.
- Game logic for dropping blocks, detecting collisions, and checking for alignment.
- Basic animation for the falling blocks.
- Back button to navigate between screens.

## Current Status

The project is still a work in progress and may contain bugs that need to be addressed. Future updates will focus on refining the game logic, improving the user interface, and fixing existing issues.

## Learning Objectives

This project has served as an opportunity to learn:

- **Java Programming**: Gaining practical experience with Java syntax and concepts.
- **Version Control with Git**: Understanding the fundamentals of using Git for version control, tracking changes, and collaborating with others.
